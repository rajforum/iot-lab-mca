To write code for blinking an LED using Tinkercad, which typically involves using an Arduino microcontroller, you can use the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment) and its programming language, which is based on C/C++. Here is a basic example of how to blink an LED:

1. **Set up your Tinkercad circuit:**
   - Place an Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno) on the workspace.
   - Connect an LED to pin 13 (or any other digital pin) of the Arduino board.
   - Connect a 220-ohm resistor in series with the LED to limit the current.
   - Connect the ground (GND) of the Arduino to the cathode (shorter leg) of the LED.

2. **Write the code:**

Here is the code to blink an LED:

```cpp
// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);                       // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);                       // wait for a second
}
```

### Explanation:

- **`setup()` function:**
  - This function runs once when the Arduino is powered on or reset.
  - `pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);` sets the built-in LED (which is connected to pin 13 on most Arduino boards) as an output.

- **`loop()` function:**
  - This function runs repeatedly in a loop.
  - `digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);` turns the LED on.
  - `delay(1000);` pauses the program for 1000 milliseconds (1 second).
  - `digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);` turns the LED off.
  - `delay(1000);` pauses the program for another second.

### Steps to simulate on Tinkercad:

1. Open [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/).
2. Click on "Circuits" and then "Create new Circuit".
3. Add an Arduino Uno board to the workspace.
4. Add an LED and a 220-ohm resistor.
5. Connect the components as described above.
6. Click on "Code" and switch to "Text" mode.
7. Copy and paste the provided code into the code editor.
8. Start the simulation to see the LED blink.
