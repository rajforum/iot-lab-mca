To measure temperature using an Arduino and a temperature sensor, you can use the LM35 temperature sensor, which provides a voltage output proportional to the temperature. Here's how you can set up the hardware and the code to read temperature values from the sensor.

### Hardware Setup:

1. **Components:**
   - Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
   - LM35 temperature sensor
   - Breadboard
   - Jumper wires

2. **Connections:**
   - Connect the `Vcc` pin of the LM35 to the `5V` pin on the Arduino.
   - Connect the `GND` pin of the LM35 to the `GND` pin on the Arduino.
   - Connect the `Output` pin of the LM35 to an analog input pin on the Arduino, e.g., `A0`.

### Code:

Here is the Arduino code to read the temperature from the LM35 sensor and display it in the Serial Monitor:

```cpp
int tempPin = A0;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  int analogValue = analogRead(tempPin);

  float miliVoltage = (analogValue/1024.0) * 3300;
  //float voltage = analogValue * (5.0 / 1023.0);

  float temperatureC = miliVoltage / 10.0;
  float temperatureF = ((temperatureC * 9.0) / 5.0) + 32.0;

  // Print the temperature values to the Serial Monitor
  Serial.print("Temperature: ");
  Serial.print(temperatureC);
  Serial.print(" °C, ");
  Serial.print(temperatureF);
  Serial.println(" °F");

  // Wait for 1 second before taking another reading
  delay(1000);
}
```

### Explanation:

- **`tempPin`**: This is the analog pin where the LM35 sensor is connected (A0 in this case).
- **`setup()`**: Initializes serial communication at 9600 baud rate for displaying data in the Serial Monitor.
- **`loop()`**: Continuously reads the analog value from the temperature sensor, converts it to voltage, then to temperature in Celsius, and finally to Fahrenheit. It prints the temperature readings to the Serial Monitor and waits for 1 second before taking another reading.

### Steps to Simulate on Tinkercad:

1. Open [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/).
2. Click on "Circuits" and then "Create new Circuit".
3. Add an Arduino Uno board to the workspace.
4. Add an LM35 temperature sensor.
5. Connect the components as described in the hardware setup section.
6. Click on "Code" and switch to "Text" mode.
7. Copy and paste the provided code into the code editor.
8. Start the simulation and open the Serial Monitor to see the temperature readings.

This setup will allow you to measure temperature using an LM35 sensor and an Arduino board, displaying the results in both Celsius and Fahrenheit in the Serial Monitor. Let me know if you need further assistance!
